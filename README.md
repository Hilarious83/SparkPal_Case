# SparkPal_Case
A Casemod for https://github.com/jamesguitar3/sparkpal

This is a partslist and some pictures from my build of the SparkPal Pedal by jamesguitar3 ()found here: https://github.com/jamesguitar3/sparkpal)

The parts are mostly just what I had lying around and can be interchanged with others of the same type. (also some of the links are for german amazon, which might not be practical depending on where you live)

There's a Photoshop and Jpeg file for my surface design of the box which prints on a DinA4 sheet and fits on a 188x119x37.5 mm box. I printed it on glossy adhesive paper, which came out of the printer with a weird pattern that wasn't intended, but I actually like it this way :D

In retrospect I should have used a bigger case b/c the switches are too close together to hit surely with your foot (see video) and the battery that I used didn't fit at the end. But I wanted a small case, so I'll use it for now.

I've also included some pictures of the building process (don't pay too much attention to my limited soldering skills plz)

Have fun jamming and hit me up if there are any questions.
